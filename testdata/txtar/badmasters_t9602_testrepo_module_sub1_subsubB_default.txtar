1.3
log
@A trunk change to sub1/subsubB/default.  This was committed about an
hour after an earlier change that affected most files on branch
B_SPLIT.  This file is not on that branch yet, but after this commit,
we'll branch to B_SPLIT, albeit rooted in a revision that didn't exist
at the time the rest of B_SPLIT was created.
@
text
@This is sub1/subsubB/default.

Every directory in the `proj' project has a file named `default'.

This line was added in the second commit (affecting all 7 files).

This bit was committed on trunk about an hour after an earlier change
to everyone else on branch B_SPLIT.  Afterwards, we'll finally branch
this file to B_SPLIT, but rooted in a revision that didn't exist at
the time the rest of B_SPLIT was created.

1.3.2.1
log
@This change affects sub3/default and sub1/subsubB/default, on branch
B_SPLIT.  Note that the latter file did not even exist on this branch
until after some other files had had revisions committed on B_SPLIT.
